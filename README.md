# Anomaly-Detection
In this dissertation, we describe a technique that helps in analyzing http traffic gathered from IoT Honeypots and relies on the statistical information to discover anomalies. The idea behind network anomaly detection is that irregular activity affects network parameters to the point that their statistical characteristics no longer remain consistent, leading in sudden shifts.
